# UI-UX-Design-Project

This project was completed as part of the UI & UX course, with a focus on addressing the challenges faced by international and first-generation students transitioning back to campus after remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project duration was 4 months and completed by 4 team members (including myslef).

## Project Background
Over the past two years, the pandemic has significantly impacted people's daily lives, changing how they socialize, interact, and manage day-to-day activities. With remote learning becoming the norm, returning to in-person classes presents unique challenges, especially for international and first-generation students. This project aimed to explore these challenges and design an interactive solution to ease the transition back to campus life.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to work through one iteration of the design process in groups. We focused on identifying key struggles faced by international and first-generation students as they returned to campus and proposed a design solution that could assist in improving their daily experiences.

## Project Phases
### Phase 1: Discover & Define

In the first phase, we aimed to understand the problems these students face. Our methods included:

* **Probes and Contextual Inquiry:** We conducted exploratory research to gather insights into the students' experiences.
* **Interviews:** Our team interviewed 5 students to identify key barriers and struggles.
* **Data Collection:** We gathered and analyzed the data to create user profiles, personas, and scenarios.
* **Design Brief:** Using the Volere Requirements Specification Template, we structured our findings into a design brief.
### Phase 2: Problem Statement & Design Solution
The second phase focused on exploring potential solutions and developing a practical design:

* **Problem Statement:** We refined the problem statement and brainstormed possible solutions.
* **Design Process:** This phase involved creating a mood board, developing a low-fidelity prototype, and eventually wireframes.
* **Interactive Prototype:** Using Figma, we created an interactive prototype to bring our solution to life.
## Tools & Methods
* **Research Methods:** Probes, Contextual Inquiry, and Interviews
* **Design Tools:** Figma, Volere Requirements Specification Template, WireFrame
* **Design Outputs:** Personas, Scenarios, Mood Board, Low-Fidelity Prototype, Wireframes, Interactive Prototype
## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive exploration of the challenges faced by international and first-generation students during the transition back to campus. Through a detailed design process, we developed a solution that can assist students in overcoming these barriers and improving their overall campus experience.
